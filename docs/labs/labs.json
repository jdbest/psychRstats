    "contents": "\nThese are the instructions for the second of two projects that were intended to practice the work done by students during the course of the semester. The list of labs is here.\nThis website contains R lab code for labs in Bard College’s Fall 2020 for Statistics for Psychology, taught by Prof. Justin Dainer-Best.\nOverview\nThis project was intended to be done in groups—but if you’re interested, you can do it on your own.\nYou will perform a data analysis on real data, using the skills you’ve developed in the labs. This project is a semester-summarizing version of the first project—you will develop research questions, create visualizations, carry out analyses, and produce a final document that reports all of them.\nYou may use any resources you choose in this (e.g., textbook, web searches, stats study rooms), although of course the work must be your own groups’ work. Adapting others’ code (e.g., from a post you find online) is great! Using someone else’s code for the exact data you have is not.\nObjectives\nAs with the first project, the goals are:\nTo help you to practice the skills learned in lab\nTo help you understand what happens in the data analysis and reporting sections of a research project\nTo give you functional skills from the use of R and RStudio\nTo learn the process behind data anlysis in published research\nDon’t forget to (a) save and (b) knit the document frequently, so you’ll keep track of your work and also know where you run into errors.\nRequirements \nThe data \nYou get to choose your dataset! You must choose one of the following datasets (or another one you let me know about), and read about it. (If you’d like to find your own, you might try looking at https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/ICPSR/index.html or https://dataverse.harvard.edu/ to find them.)\nHere are the datasets I suggest:\nClimate Change in the American Mind: National Survey Data on Public Opinion (2008-2017): https://osf.io/w36gn/\nCorrelates of War: https://correlatesofwar.org/data-sets\nWorld Values Survey: http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSContents.jsp\nPro Publica data on criminal justice: https://www.propublica.org/datastore/datasets/criminal-justice\nPro Publica data on health: https://www.propublica.org/datastore/datasets/health\nFBI Hate Crime Reports: https://github.com/emorisse/FBI-Hate-Crime-Statistics/tree/master/2013\nWhichever data you decide to use, you should (a) read about it in detail, (b) plan to cite the data in APA style, and (c) make sure that you can read the data into R. You can message me with questions on that topic. You may need to do some data processing. Any processing that you do before importing it into R (e.g., opening it up in Google Sheets or Excel and renaming columns) should be reported in your final document.\nSome of these datasets may require more processing than others.\nHypotheses, Preregistration, and Introduction\nYou should plan to frame testable hypotheses which involve some of the variables described in your dataset. Those should include both a research hypothesis (\\(H_1\\)) and a null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)).\nYour statistical framing of the hypotheses (involving means) should assume two-tailed tests. However, your preregistration should also suggest the direction you anticipate. For example, will a correlation be positive or negative? Which group will have higher scores? Will the chi-squared test find independence? All tests (described further immediately below this section) should have a preregistered hypothesis.\nPlease refer to the bottom of this document for an abbreviated preregistration template.\nIn the final document, you should also include a brief introduction which describes the data and cites it, reports your directional hypotheses, and explains why you’ve made those hypotheses.\nAnalyses\nStatistical tests\nYou should use multiple statistical tests that provide evidence for or against your hypotheses. At minimum, you must conduct tests that fall into three of the following groups: (1) regression or correlation, (2) one-way or factorial ANOVA, (3) independent-samples or decedent-samples t-tests, (4) chi-squared test.\nIf you’re assigning the results of a test to a variable (e.g., model <- lm(DV ~ IV1 * IV2, data = data)), then you must also print the model (so that I can see what it looks like):\nmodel <- lm(DV ~ IV1 * IV2, data = data)\nmodel\nanova(model)\nAll tests must be interpreted immediately (in the document) after the code, with the results printed in the final document. Your interpretation should always include whether the test is significant or not. It frequently will be useful to include the group means. As always, you should generally round to two significant digits after the decimal.\nPlots \nYou should create at least four plots (figures). At least two of those should involve some sort of comparison between variables—i.e., not simply be histograms or boxplots. Several plots should help you interpret the results of the tests. The plots should be “in-line,” meaning that they follow the relevant section. For example, a bar graph might be useful immediately following your running a factorial ANOVA.\nBrief discussion\nAfter all tests, you should include a “discussion section” which explains what your tests found and why it matters (or does not). Null results are absolutely fine!\nThe documents\nFor both the preregistration and the final document, you should plan to create a new R Markdown document for your final project. Your document should include the following “code” at the top (replacing what is automatically generated), with your title after “title” and your names under the - marks following “author”. You should knit that document.\n---\ntitle: \nauthor: \n  - First name here\ndate: \noutput: \n  html_document:\n    self_contained: yes\n---\nPreregistration template\nUse the following for your preregistration in a new R Markdown document. Note that the language under the headers (i.e., the bits that don’t start with a #) should be deleted—they’re just explaining the section.\n# Variables\n## Independent Variables What are your independent / grouping / predictor variables (including mediators and moderators) ? Explain how you operationalize each variable\n## Dependent Variables What are your dependent / outcome variables? Explain how you operationalize each variable.\n# Hypotheses What are your primary study hypotheses / research questions?\n# Sampling What is the sample size?\n## Sample characteristics Who is the sample representing?\n# Analysis plan\n## Significance threshold What will be your criterion for determining statistical significance?\n## Exclusion criteria Will you exclude participants from data analysis based on any of the reasons listed below? Failed attention check; Failed manipulation check; Missing data\n## Outliers What criterion (if any) will you use to determine whether a participant is an outlier?\n## Statistical tests Which statistical tests will you use to conduct your data analyses? ANOVA; Correlation; t-test; Chi-square; Regression; Other/Additional\nIf relevant, describe what types of follow-up tests will you perform (e.g., post-hoc; simple main effects). If you will conduct planned comparisons, explain the nature of those comparisons\nNote that there are no “solutions” for this document.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nThe first steps involve setting up R and RStudio, getting acquainted with them, and making sure everything is working.\nInstall R\nIf you are using your own computer\nInstall R from https://cran.r-project.org/—it is available for Mac OS, Windows, and Linux. Choose the appropriate link, download, and install.\nInstall RStudio from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/—choose the free “RStudio Desktop” (all the way to the left). You can run R without RStudio, but I strongly recommend using RStudio (since that is what you’ll be seeing for all examples).\nIf you are using RStudio Cloud\nMake an account on RStudio.Cloud, and then skip to the next section.\nInstall this package\nOnce you’ve installed R, but before doing anything else, you can install this package. Doing so will also install a number of other imoportant packages.\nOccasionally R may ask you questions like “These packages have more recent versions available. It is recommended to update all of them. Which would you like to update?” And you will need to select a response (e.g., type 1 and hit enter to download all updates).\n\n\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\ndevtools::install_github(\"jdbest/psychRstats\")\n\n\n\nInstalling the package will also install all of the tutorials. However, I’ve also written exercises, which you’ll want to download somewhere on your machine. For that purpose, you should follow the instructions below on setting a working directory and then downloading exercises.\nSet a working directory\nYou’ll need to make a decision about what will be your “working directory”. The working directory is the folder on your computer where you’ll be storing the exercise files, and where R assumes you’re working. (For example, you might use the “Downloads” folder on most computers is located in your user folder/Downloads, e.g., mine might be in /Users/jdbest/Downloads on a Mac or in C:/Users/jdbest/Downloads on a PC.)\nThere’s more info on this on the github wiki. You can always return there with questions.\nUse the Session > Set Working Directory menu. Navigate to whatever folder you’ll be using for this class. (You might want to use something like /yourusername/psychRstats/labs – but anything is fine so long as you know where it is.) This is the sort of folder that when you go to Finder (Mac) or Windows Explorer (PC), you can find all of the files associated with this class in one place. (If you’re on a shared computer, you may have limited choices. Documents folders are fine!)\nOptional: You can permanently set your working directory using the Tools Menu. Go to Tools: Global Options, and then click the “Browse…” under Default working directory. Navigate to the same folder you just set.\nIf you’re familiar with some coding, you can also set your working directory using the setwd() command—just be sure to enclose the path in quotation marks, e.g., setwd(\"/yourusername/psychRstats/labs\").\n(Read more about working directories in R and RStudio.)\nTo check that you’ve got the right working directory set up, run the following code in the RStudio console (just copy and paste it and then hit enter):\n\n\ngetwd()\n\n\n\nDoes it say what you expected it to? If not, either ask for help or read through the above again.\nRStudio Cloud\nYour files will download to “/home/rstudio-user” – if when you run getwd() you don’t get that, run the following code: setwd(\"/home/rstudio-user\").\nIf you want to download files from the Cloud to your own computer, follow these instructions.\nDownload exercises\nWhen you have decided on your working directory—even if you’re sticking with \"~\" (your user folder), you can download the lab exercises. They will all download from a zip file, and all be R Markdown files designed to run in RStudio. You should have downloaded the package before this will work:\n\n\npsychRstats::download_exercises()\n\n\n\nThe lab documents will download to your computer in the directory (folder) you defined above—into your working directory. (If you didn’t define it, it’ll download into whatever working directory was the default, usually your user folder.) It may pop up a folder where the file lives.\nErrors and Problems\nIf you run into any errors, consider looking to the wiki page on troubleshooting for solutions. (You can also scroll up and click “Wiki”.)\nThe first tutorial\nAll right! Now that you’ve gotten everything installed, run the first tutorial:\n\n\npsychRstats::lab(\"01-intro-to-r\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
