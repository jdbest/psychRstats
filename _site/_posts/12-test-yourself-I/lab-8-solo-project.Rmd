The primary website for this course is <https://faculty.bard.edu/~jdainerbest/psy-203>

These are all of the instructions for the solo project. [The list of labs is here](../../labslist.html).

This website contains R lab code for labs in Bard College's Fall 2020 for Statistics for Psychology, taught by Prof. Justin Dainer-Best. 

You will download the lab's files to your computer or to your rstudio.cloud account.

## Objectives

This lab asks you to practice the skills you have learned about running *t*-tests and visualizing the results, as well as reporting them. It also expects you to practice using `filter()` and otherwise subsetting data. As [described in the syllabus](../../syllabus.html#solo-project), the solo project is _designed to be completed alone_, and allows you to apply the code we've been learning in lab to a research question. This project helps you practice adapting code from previous work to a new question. 

## Make sure you're in the right working directory

Set your working directory if necessary. Check that you're in the directory you expect by running `getwd()` in the Console. If you need more help, [look at the wiki page on setting a working directory](https://github.com/jdbest/psy-203/wiki/setting-a-working-directory). 

## The solo project

To download the project and the data it relies on, run the following command. **Please note: only run the `usethis::usezip()` line once! Running it again will result in your overwriting the files on your computer---potentially losing your work.**

Make sure you run the whole command, all the way to the closing parenthesis.

```
usethis::use_zip(paste0("https://github.com/jdbest/",
                        "psy-203/raw/master/lab08.zip"), 
                        cleanup = TRUE)
```

For most users, a window will pop up with the solo project. Double click on it to open it, or select it from the Files pane in RStudio.
