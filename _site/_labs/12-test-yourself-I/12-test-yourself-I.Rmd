These are the instructions for the first of two projects that were intended to practice the work done by students during the course of the semester. [The list of labs is here](../../labs.html).

This website contains R lab code for labs in Bard College's Fall 2020 for Statistics for Psychology, taught by Prof. Justin Dainer-Best. 

## Objectives

This project asks you to practice the skills you have learned about running *t*-tests and visualizing the results, as well as reporting them. It also expects you to practice using `filter()` and otherwise subsetting data. This project helps you practice adapting code from previous work to a new question. 

## Make sure you're in the right working directory

Set your working directory if necessary. Check that you're in the directory you expect by running `getwd()` in the Console. If you need more help, [look at the wiki page on setting a working directory](https://github.com/jdbest/psychRstats/wiki/setting-a-working-directory). 

## The project

You should have downloaded the exercise and data already; today's file is called "12-test-yourself-I.Rmd". Either open the file (in R through the Files pane, or by double-clicking on the file in your file browser), or you may be able to open the file from the correct working directory by running the following code:

```{r}
library(psychRstats)
run_exercise("12-test-yourself-I")
```
