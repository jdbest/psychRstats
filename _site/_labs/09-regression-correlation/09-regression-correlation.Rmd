These are all of the instructions for Lab 9. [The list of labs is here](../../labs.html).

This repository contains R labs for R package ([`{psychRstats}`](https://github.com/jdbest/psychRstats)) based on Bard Collegeâ€™s Statistics for Psychology (PSY 203, Fall 2020), taught by Assistant Professor of Psychology Justin Dainer-Best.

For each lab, you should expect to download the lab's files locally to your computer, and run them there. If you're using https://rstudio.cloud/ instead of running things locally, the same instructions should work today. 

Below are instructions for Lab 9.

## Today's tutorial

This lab will walk you through running correlations and regression in R, using functions like `cor.test()` and `cor()` for the former and `summary()` and `lm()` (linear model) for the latter. You'll also practice using the **{ggplot2}** package to create scatterplots with regression lines. 

To run the tutorial:

```{r}
library(psychRstats)
psychRstats::lab("09-cor-reg")
```

Once you've completed the tutorial, return here for the exercise that you will complete at the end of the lab. (If you'd like to keep the tutorial open, refer to [this page on the wiki](https://github.com/jdbest/psychRstats/wiki/Run-a-tutorial-and-exercise-simultaneously).)

## Make sure you're in the right working directory

In the first lab, we set the working directory to a specific folder where every lab for this class will live. If you don't remember, [look at the wiki page I've created on setting a working directory](https://github.com/jdbest/psychRstats/wiki/setting-a-working-directory). 

Check that you're in the directory you expect by running `getwd()` (the parentheses should have nothing in them). 

## Exercise

You should have downloaded the exercise and data already; today's file is called "09-exercise.Rmd". Either open the file (in R through the Files pane, or by double-clicking on the file in your file browser), or you may be able to open the file from the correct working directory by running the following code:

```{r}
library(psychRstats)
run_exercise("09-exercise")
```
