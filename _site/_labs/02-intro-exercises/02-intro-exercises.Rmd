For each lab, you should expect to download the lab's files locally to your computer, and run them there. If you're using https://rstudio.cloud/ instead of running things locally, the same instructions should work today. 

## Previous labs

[Find the full list of labs here](../../labs.html). 

* [Find Lab 1 here](../01-intro-to-r/)

Below are instructions for the exercise corresponding to that tutorial.

## Make sure you're in the right working directory

In the first lab, we set the working directory to a specific folder where every lab for this class will live. If you don't remember, [look at the wiki page I've created on setting a working directory](https://github.com/jdbest/psychRstats/wiki/setting-a-working-directory). 

Check that you're in the directory you expect by running `getwd()` (the parentheses should have nothing in them). Just copy and paste that into the console and hit return/enter.

## Today's lab

If you haven't already completed the tutorial, you can open it up by pasting the following lines to run in your RStudio console, which will open the tutorial. 

```{r}
library(psychRstats)
lab("01-intro-to-r")
```

Once you've completed the tutorial, return here for an exercise that you will turn in at the end of the lab. Make sure that you *close the tutorial window*. (If you'd like to keep it open, refer to [this page on the wiki](https://github.com/jdbest/psychRstats/wiki/Run-a-tutorial-and-exercise-simultaneously).)

## Exercise

This exercise gives you the opportunity to do the following: 

1. Practice selecting subsets of data.
2. Understand how to load a package.
3. Practice writing your own code in an R Markdown document. 

You should have downloaded the exercises already. If not, [click here](../01-intro-to-r/#download-exercises).

Today's file is called "02-lab.Rmd". Either open the file (in R through the Files pane, or by double-clicking on the file in your file browser), or (if in the correct working directory) you should be able to open the file by running the following code:

```{r}
library(psychRstats)
run_exercise("02-exercise")
```
