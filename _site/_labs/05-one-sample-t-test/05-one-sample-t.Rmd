These are all of the instructions for Lab 5. [The list of labs is here](../../labs.html).

This repository contains R labs for R package ([`{psychRstats}`](https://github.com/jdbest/psychRstats)) based on Bard Collegeâ€™s Statistics for Psychology (PSY 203, Fall 2020), taught by Assistant Professor of Psychology Justin Dainer-Best.

For each lab, you should expect to download the lab's files locally to your computer, and run them there. If you're using https://rstudio.cloud/ instead of running things locally, the same instructions should work today. 

Below are instructions for Lab 5.

## Objectives

The following lab *builds* on your skills with `ggplot2`, using `filter()`, and helps you practice using *z*-scores and *t*-scores to test simple sample means. This lab anticipates that you have read or have a background on *t*-tests; however, most of the lab reviews material you have already covered in previous labs.

## Make sure you're in the right working directory

Set your working directory if necessary. Check that you're in the directory you expect by running `getwd()` in the Console. If you need more help, [look at the wiki page on setting a working directory](https://github.com/jdbest/psychRstats/wiki/setting-a-working-directory). 

## Today's lab

There is no tutorial today; you'll be focusing on an R Markdown file. 

Check that you're in the directory you expect by running `getwd()` (the parentheses should have nothing in them). 

## Exercise

This exercise explores the commands you learned and lets you continue practicing the steps of hypothesis testing. 

You may be able to open the file from the correct working directory by running the following code:

```{r}
library(psychRstats)
run_exercise("05-exercise")
```
