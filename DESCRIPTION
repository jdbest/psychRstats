Description: Based on Bard College's Statistics for Psychology (PSY 203, Fall 
    2020, taught by Assistant Professor of Psychology Justin Dainer-Best), these
    vignettes and exercises are intended to be used alongside an undergraduate 
    course in statistics, or an understanding of statistics based on such a course. 
    It includes a series of vignettes and exercises which build on one another 
    to develop skills while also exploring basic statistical concepts like the 
    t-test, ANOVA, or null-hypothesis statistical testing.
